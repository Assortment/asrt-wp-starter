# WPST
A logical approach to WordPress Theme Development

---

WPST is a boilerplate for WordPress which provides a structured foundation for Developers who are a looking to use higher-level concepts found in popular PHP frameworks such as Laravel and Symfony.

One of its key features is in its folder structure, which has been engineered to mimic the Model, View, Controller concepts that everyone is used to. Whilst not a true representation, it does allow for a more logical grouping of functionality.

## Requirements

- **WordPress 4.5.3+**: First and foremost, this is a WordPress theme and is required to be installed as such.
- **PHP v5.3.0+**: WPST uses syntax only found in newer versions of PHP.

## Unsupported/Untested

Most of the following is untested rather than unsupported, which will change as the project matures:

- **PHP 7**: No reason this shouldn't work, however, it has been untested.
- **WordPress < 4.5.3**: We work with the latest few versions of WordPress, no reason it won't work though.

Want to support these? Create a fork of the project, let us know and once vetted we'll happily provide a link in here to your project.
